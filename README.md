# GSAT vs probSAT

This repository contains experimental comparison of the algorithms GSAT and probSAT for 3-SAT with 20-75 variables

## SAT problem

The **Boolean Satisfiability Problem**, commonly known as SAT, is a problem that involves determining whether a given boolean formula is satisfiable. In other words, whether there is such an assignment to the variables that makes proposition true. 

## 3-SAT

The 3-SAT problem has at most 3 literals for each clause. It's NP-Complete problem.
